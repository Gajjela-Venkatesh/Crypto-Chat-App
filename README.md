# Crypto Chat App

**Base64 Encoding:** The application uses base64 encoding to securely transform messages.

**Clipboard Functionality:** Easily copy encrypted or decrypted messages to your clipboard for effortless sharing.

**User-Friendly Interface:** The design is straightforward and intuitive, allowing for smooth user interaction.

**Password Protection:** Messages are protected from unauthorized access by requiring a password for decryption.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Used to create the web page's structure.
- **CSS:** Used for styling and providing a responsive, modern look to the app.
- **JavaScript:** Manages the encryption and decryption logic, implementing base64 encoding and decoding.

## Installation
Follow these steps to get the Crypto Chat App up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gajjela-Venkatesh/crypto-chat-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd crypto-chat-app
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

There is no need for any server-side setup; the app runs entirely on the client side.

## Usage
Once you have the app open in your browser, hereâ€™s how to use it:

### Encrypt a Message:
1. Type your message into the message input box.
2. Enter a password in the password field.
3. Click the "Encrypt" button to generate the encrypted message.
4. The encrypted message (ciphertext) will appear on the screen.

### Decrypt a Message:
1. Paste the encrypted message into the message input box.
2. Enter the correct password used for encryption.
3. Click the "Decrypt" button to view the original message.

### Copy Messages:
After encryption or decryption, click the "Copy" button to copy the message to your clipboard for easy sharing.

## How It Works
- **Message Encryption:** The message is first converted into ASCII and then encoded into base64 format. This transformation makes the message unreadable without the correct password.
  
- **Message Decryption:** Users input the correct password to decrypt the message. The app reverses the encryption process, converting the base64 message back into the original text.

- **Base64 Encoding:** Base64 encoding is a common method used to encode binary data into a string format safe for transmission over text-based protocols. This app utilizes base64 for both the encryption and decryption of messages.
